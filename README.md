# Computer Vision Applications with PyTorch

This repository contains implementations of various computer vision applications using PyTorch, including both established models and new research contributions.

<br>

## Projects
1. **Image Segmentation (UNet)**  
   PyTorch implementation of UNet for image segmentation.

2. **Object Detection (YOLOv1 - YOLOv8)**  
   PyTorch implementation of YOLOv1 for real-time object detection.

<br>

## Upcoming Projects
- **Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Their Applications**
- **Self-Supervised Learning for Vision Tasks**
- **Multi-Modal Learning (Vision Language Models)**
- **And More**
